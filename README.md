### Ph.D. LaTeX Template. Max Planck Institute and Jacobs University Bremen.

The Template consists of the main.tex file, and the chapters, and subfiles loaded in the main.tex file.

* To compile the main.tex simply run `make`.  
* To clean up the building directory (e.g., when re-compiling) run `make clean`. 

This template was adapted from [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex).
