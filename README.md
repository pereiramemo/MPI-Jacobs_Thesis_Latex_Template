### Ph.D. LaTeX Template. Max Planck Institute and Jacobs University Bremen.

The Template consists of the main.tex file, and the chapters, and subfiles loaded in the main.tex file.

To compile the main.tex simply run `make` or `make clean` to clean up the building directory (e.g., when recompiling).

This template was adapted from Overleaf[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex].
